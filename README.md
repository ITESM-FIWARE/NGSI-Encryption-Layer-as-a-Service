# NGSI-Encryption-Layer-as-a-Service

This document describes the encryption service developed at ITESM as a tool for encrypting and decrypting [FIWARE data models](https://www.fiware.org/developers/data-models/). 

[FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) is a curated framework of open source platform components to accelerate the development of Smart solutions. The [FIWARE platform](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/) provides a rather simple yet powerful set of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) that ease the development of Smart Applications in multiple vertical sectors. 

The main and only mandatory component of any "Powered by FIWARE" platform or solution is the [FIWARE Orion Context Broker Generic Enabler](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/), which brings a cornerstone function in any smart solution: the need to manage context information in a highly decentralized and large-scale manner, enabling to perform updates and bring access to context.

[FIWARE data models](https://www.fiware.org/developers/data-models/) have been harmonized to enable data portability for different applications including, but not limited, to Smart Cities. They are intended to be used together with [FIWARE NGSI version 2](https://www.fiware.org/2016/06/08/fiware-ngsi-version-2-release-candidate/).

The application can be seen as two stand-alone services, one that uses tokens as a security measure and the second one that uses sessions as a security measure. Both stand-alone services enable the encryption and decryption of all up-to-date available FIWARE data models published in [FIWARE Data Models official site](https://www.fiware.org/developers/data-models/). 
First, the overall overview of the encryption service is described; secondly, the stand-alone service that uses tokens is introduced; lastly, the stand-alone service that uses sessions is detailed.
